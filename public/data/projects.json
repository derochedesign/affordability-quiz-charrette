Holding land in the public good allows the community to remain in place and protects this complete community, leading to a healthy mix of tenures, incomes, services, businesses, shops, opportunities and people, ultimately creating an affordable neighbourhood that benefits all.\n\nWe used West Neighbourhood House(WNH) as a case study to study the In-Place model to work best for any community hubs.\n\nThis program allows the senior to age in place, staying in their home longer not only because some capital is unlocked monthly for them, but also because the home is renovated and maintained to a higher standard. WNH stands to generate some revenue, which they can reinvest in the program, while also maintaining or further densifying the area with new rental units.",
