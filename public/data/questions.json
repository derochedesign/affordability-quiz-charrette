            "answer": "Canadian women make on average 63 cents for every dollar a man makes. Women also negotiate less than their male counterparts. A recent study found that 68% of women accepted the salary they were offered and did not negotiate while only 52% of men did not negotiate.",

            "insightLabel":"Childcare",
            "answer": "Subsidizing childcare would mean paying for it from taxes, in the same way that education and healthcare are paid for. Additionally, providing parents with the opportunity to afford childcare would enable them to work and spend money elsewhere in the economy. Subsidizing childcare would benefit our future taxpayers, our fellow employees and our economic bottom line.",

If you're caught without a proof-of-payment, you may face a fine upwards of $400. If you couldn't even afford the $3.25 proof-of-payment, it's going to be next to impossible to pay off that fine.

In New York, the average commute time is 34.8 minutes in one direction. But when you look closer, you notice that women and minority groups have longer commutes, indicating they are forced to make unfair choices and live even farther from where they work.",

There are often higher tarrifs charged on products targeted to women and girls, driving up the prices.

However, 52% of peeople would oppose this kind of development in their neighbourhood. When homeowners oppose these kinds of development in order to protect their homes, they might be denying others the same rights and benefits they enjoy as home owners and community members.",

This cost includes things like community supports, emergency services, emergency shelters, healthcare and criminial justice. This doesn't account for the social costs.

A whole range of unexpected jobs and industries will be disrupted if we're not prepared. For example, robo-accounting is on the rise as robots are better than humans at number crunching, inventory tracking and accounts payable. Although we often assume that jobs that require human skills like creativity are safe, it turns out that AI can write too. The Associated Press started using intelligent software to write earnings reports. Itâ€™s possible that written content of the future can be produced without humans at all.",
